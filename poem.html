<h1>What is Youth?</h1>
<h2>by Mario Benedetti</h2>
<h2>Buenos Aires, Argentina</h2>
<h2>1998</h2>

<p class="poem">What is left fot young people to prove? 
  In this world of patience and disgust?
  Just graffiti? rock? skepticism?
  They also have left not to say amen
  to not let their love be killed
  to regain their speech and utopia
  to be young without haste and with memory
  placed in a history that is theirs 
  to not become prematurely old.</p>
<p class="poem">What is left for young people to prove?
  In this world of routine and ruin?
  Cocaine? Beer? Hooligans?
  They have left to breathe and open their eyes
  to discover the roots of horror
  to invent peace, even if through violent means 
  to understand nature 
  and with the rain and lightning 
  and with the feeling and death 
  that is hard to understand.</p>
<p class="poem">What is left to prove to young people?
  In this world of consumption and smoke?
  Vertigo? Assaults? Clubs?
  They also have left to argue with God
  whether or not he exists
  to reach out with a helping hands and to open doors
  for ones own heart and other's 
  especially they have left to make a future
  despite the ruins of the past
  and rogue scholars of the present.</p>
